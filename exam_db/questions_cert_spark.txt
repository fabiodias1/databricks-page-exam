The below code block contains an error. The code block is intended to return a new DataFrame that
is the result of an inner join between DataFrame storesDF and DataFrame employeesDF on
column storeId and column employeeIdwhich are in both DataFrames. Identify the error.
Code block:
storesDF.join(employeesDF, [col("storeId"), col("employeeId")])
A. The join() operation is a standalone function rather than a method of DataFrame — the
join() operation should be called where its first two arguments are storesDF and
employeesDF.
B. There must be a third argument to join() because the default to the how parameter is not
"inner".
C. The col("storeId") and col("employeeId") arguments should not be separate
elements of a list — they should be tested to see if they're equal to one another like
col("storeId") == col("employeeId").
D. There is no DataFrame.join() operation — DataFrame.merge() should be used
instead.
E. The references to "storeId" and "employeeId" should not be inside the col()
function — removing the col() function should result in a successful join.
Question 54
Which of the following Spark properties is used to configure the broadcasting of a DataFrame
without the use of the broadcast() operation?
A. spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold
B. spark.sql.broadcastTimeout
C. spark.broadcast.blockSize
D. spark.broadcast.compress
E. spark.executor.memoryOverhead
Question 55
The code block shown below should return a new DataFrame that is the result of a cross join
between DataFrame storesDF and DataFrame employeesDF. Choose the response that
correctly fills in the numbered blanks within the code block to complete this task.
Code block:
__1__.__2__(__3__)
A.
1. storesDF
2. crossJoin
3. employeesDF, "storeId"
B.
1. storesDF
2. join
3. employeesDF, "cross"
C.
1. storesDF
2. crossJoin
3. employeesDF, "storeId"
D.
1. storesDF
2. join
3. employeesDF, "storeId", "cross"
E.
1. storesDF
2. crossJoin
3. employeesDF
Question 56
Which of the following operations performs a position-wise union on two DataFrames?
A. The standalone concat() function
B. The standalone unionAll() function
C. The standalone union() function
D. DataFrame.unionByName()
E. DataFrame.union()
Question 57
Which of the following code blocks writes DataFrame storesDF to file path filePath as
parquet?
A. storesDF.write.option("parquet").path(filePath)
B. storesDF.write.path(filePath)
C. storesDF.write().parquet(filePath)
D. storesDF.write(filePath)
E. storesDF.write.parquet(filePath)
Question 58
The code block shown below contains an error. The code block is intended to write DataFrame
storesDF to file path filePath as parquet and partition by values in column division. Identify
the error.
Code block:
storesDF.write.repartition("division").parquet(filePath)
A. The argument division to operation repartition() should be wrapped in the col()
function to return a Column object.
B. There is no parquet() operation for DataFrameWriter — the save() operation should be
used instead.
C. There is no repartition() operation for DataFrameWriter — the partitionBy()
operation should be used instead.
D. DataFrame.write is an operation — it should be followed by parentheses to return a
DataFrameWriter.
E. The mode() operation must be called to specify that this write should not overwrite
existing files.
Question 59
Which of the following code blocks reads a parquet at the file path filePath into a DataFrame?
A. spark.read().parquet(filePath)
B. spark.read().path(filePath, source = "parquet")
C. spark.read.path(filePath, source = "parquet")
D. spark.read.parquet(filePath)
E. spark.read().path(filePath)
Question 60
Which of the following code blocks reads JSON at the file path filePath into a DataFrame
with the specified schema schema?
A. spark.read().schema(schema).format(json).load(filePath)
B. spark.read().schema(schema).format("json").load(filePath)
C. spark.read.schema("schema").format("json").load(filePath)
D. spark.read.schema("schema").format("json").load(filePath)
E. spark.read.schema(schema).format("json").load(filePath)
